# 100 Days of Code / Python Bootcamp

I am doing this as a Udemy course which is taught by Dr. Angela Yu. I am taking this course in tandem with Jose Portilla's Complete Python Bootcamp. As I move through the course, I will continue uploading the projects I find interesting.

## Purpose

I am taking these courses with the goal of learning Python and becoming familiar with tools such as GitHub to eventually make some form of career change.
